- **University-Style Curriculum Tracks**  
  Structured “Foundations → Core → Specialization → Capstone” pathways, bingeable on mobile or desktop.

- **Adaptive Personalization Engine**  
  AI-driven recommendations with “Why?” explainability, tailoring every learner’s journey.

- **Interactive Virtual Labs & AI Tutor**  
  In-browser sandboxes, AR/VR lab stubs, and a GPT-powered assistant with source citations.

- **Modular Micro-Modules**  
  Drag-and-drop builder for videos, quizzes, prompts, and hands-on exercises.

- **Social Pods & Community**  
  Real-time study rooms, peer challenges, mentor booking, and gamified streaks.

- **Expert Partner Program**  
  Curated content co-created with industry specialists under a revenue-share + equity model.

- **Transparent, Up-Front Pricing**  
  One-time fees per track, bundle discounts, and no endless flash sales.
